# AndroidTCPConnection
Android TCP Connection Library with 2 excellent classes: TCPClient + TCPServer_Multithreaded

TCPClient: Is a TCP client class which can communicate with Server.

TCPServer_Multithreaded: Is a powerful TCP Server class which can manage infinity number of clients or send a message to a specific clients and too many other useful functions.

Note: Class TCPClient is only for Android (not other Java applications) because it uses Android AsyncTask class for handling the Client.

Note: Class TCPServer_Multithreaded is for Java and you change its package name, then use it for other Java projects (because it uses Java classes like: Thread, Runnable, Socket, and other Java classes).

This classes are free and anyone can use that or change it.
